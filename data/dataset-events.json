His first album, Too Long in the Wasteland (released in 1989), was produced by John Mellencamp and marked the beginning of a series of acclaimed projects for Columbia and Sugar Hill. In 1996, McMurtry received a Grammy nomination for his Longform Music Video of Where'd You Hide The Body. 1997's It Had To Happen received the American Indie Award for Best Americana Album.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, McMurtry released the universally lauded Live in Aught-Three on Compadre Records. 2005's Childish Things garnered some of the highest critical praise of McMurtry's career and spent six weeks at No. 1 on the Americana Music Radio Chart in 2005 and 2006. In September 2006, Childish Things and \"We Can't Make It Here\" won the Americana Music Awards for Album and Song of the Year, respectively. McMurtry received more Americana Music Award nominations for 2008's Just Us Kids. This album marked his highest Billboard 200 chart position in more than 19 years.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Live in Europe was released, capturing The McMurtry Band's first European tour and extraordinary live set. Along with seasoned band members Ronnie Johnson, Daren Hess, and Tim Holt, the disc features special guests Ian McLagan and Jon Dee Graham. Also, for the first time ever, video of the James McMurtry Band's live performance is available on the included DVD.\r\n\r\nThe poignant lyrics of his immense catalog still ring true today. In 2011, \"We Can't Make It Here\" was cited among 'The Nation's' \"Best Protest Songs Ever.\" Bob Lefsetz writes, \"'We Can't Make It Here' has stood the test of time because of its unmitigated truth.\"\r\n\r\nNever one to rest on his laurels, James McMurtry continues to tour constantly, and consistently puts on a \"must-see\" powerhouse performance. 'The Washington Post' noted McMurtry's live prowess: \"Much attention is paid to James McMurtry's lyrics, and rightfully so: He creates a novel's worth of emotion and experience in four minutes of blisteringly stark couplets. What gets overlooked, however, is that he's an accomplished rock guitar player. At a sold-out Birchmere, the Austin-based artist was joined by drummer Daren Hess and bassist Ronnie Johnson in a set that demonstrated the raw power of wince-inducing imagery propelled by electric guitar. It was serious stuff, imparted by a singularly serious band.\"\r\nJAMES McMURTRY LIVE IN EUROPE CD WITH BONUS DVD DOCUMENTS FIRST EURO TOUR WITH GUESTS IAN MCLAGAN AND JON DEE GRAHAM\r\nOn October 13, 2009, Lightning Rod Records released Live in Europe, a document of McMurtry's first European tour, on which, along with long-time band members Ronnie Johnson, Daren Hess, and Tim Holt, he was joined by keyboardist Ian McLagan and fellow Texas songwriting legend Jon Dee Graham. The set is available as a CD with a bonus DVD, or as a deluxe vinyl LP package with a CD and DVD insert. In early 2009, James McMurtry and his trio traveled overseas to play their first European tour. The guys played for enthusiastic crowds in Germany, Great Britain, Ireland, The Netherlands, Scotland and Belgium. Joining the band on keyboards for the tour was the legendary Ian McLagan (who also played on McMurtry's latest studio album, Just Us Kids). The best recordings from the Amsterdam, The Netherlands and Geislingen, Germany concerts were combined to create Live in Europe. The album includes a bonus DVD featuring performances from the Amsterdam show. This marks the first time fans will be able to purchase video footage of McMurtry live in concert. The deluxe vinyl version includes inserted copies of the CD and DVD. Fellow Austin-based songwriter Jon Dee Graham opened the shows and joins the band on a version of his tune \"Laredo\" on the bonus DVD.\r\nJAMES McMURTRY ALBUMS REISSUED: 'CHILDISH THINGS' \u0026 'LIVE IN AUGHT-THREE' \r\nOn February 1, 2011, two of James McMurtry's most popular albums, Childish Things and Live in Aught-Three were reissued by Lightning Rod Records. Live in Aught-Three has been remastered since its original 2004 release and will be available on vinyl for the first time. The deluxe double LP also includes a copy of the album on CD.","songs":[{"title":"Ain't Got A Place","soundcloud_url":"","soundcloud_furl":"https://soundcloud.com/complicatedgame/03-03-aint-got-a-place","duration":"2:41"}],"videos":[{"youtubeid":"4bE3DVMwjfw","title":"How'm I Gonna Find You Now"},{"youtubeid":"IM_BjzDCDXs","title":"Copper Canteen"}]},{"name":"Max Gomez","website":"http://www.maxgomezmusic.com/","facebook":"maxgomezmusic","description":"The most northern of the New Mexico pueblos, the hamlet of Taos, sits approximately 7,000 feet above sea level. It is an hour and half drive north of Santa Fe, or rather, just remote enough to stave off the casually curious person. Fiercely independent, the town, steeped in natural beauty, has long attracted artists and freethinkers of every stripe. It is within this bouillabaisse of nature, art and spirituality that we encounter Max Gomez. A young singer-songwriter in the seasoned vein of Jackson Browne and John Prine, Gomez grew up splitting his time between the sloping mountains of Taos and, for a period, the rolling plains of Kansas. On his family’s ranch in Kansas, Gomez still lends a hand with chores but relishes the time he can spend out on the lake practicing the art of fly-fishing. But it is in Taos, where he was ultimately inspired to explore his art and the ethos behind it.\r\n\r\nThe son of an artisanal furniture craftsman, Gomez grew up watching his father, learning the tools of the trade while simultaneously learning his way around the frets of his guitar. The workmanlike quality of his songwriting carries over from his days spent in the woodshed through an economy of words, phrase and narrative. A blues enthusiast from an early age, the young Gomez immersed himself in the primordial Delta and traditional folk blues of Lead Belly, Big Bill Broonzy and, of course, Robert Johnson. Though 1,200 miles and decades removed from his Mississippi heroes, Gomez had his imagination to fill in the gaps. Having honed his chops on the blues, Max turned his interest to traditional American folk music; “I’m influenced by the old stuff,” Max admits. “To me, that’s the best music.” As the Harry Smith anthology gave way to contemporary masters Townes Van Zandt, Kris Kristofferson, Guy Clark and John Hiatt, so did Gomez's songwriting. “The songs I write are not real straightforward. You have to decode them. I like when the listener has to create their own story, rather than be told what’s happening.” In short, storytelling that oscillates between everyman poetics and enigma.\r\n\r\nIn the span of its ten songs, the Jeff Trott (Stevie Nicks, Sheryl Crow) produced Rule The World traverses varying themes of heartbreak, regret, young love, desperation and, ultimately redemption. \"Run From You\", the album’s first single and co-written with Trott, reveals Max’s story telling skills. Gomez explains, “Sometimes I refer to this one as an anti-love song. We all come across trouble and often take the wrong road even when we know we should turn back.\" With his smoky voice, Gomez sings of desperation for change on “Rule The World” and on \"Never Say Never\", young love is likened to a \"cool kiss in the August summer heat,\" as the protagonist laments its fleeting nature. While the LP's pop instincts are evident, Rule The World is balanced by Gomez's love of roots music; see the blues-driven \"Ball And Chain.\" \r\n\r\nWhile many young artists write songs with the mere intention of entertaining the masses, Max's songs are filled with the raw emotion and capture the spirit of those who came before him. In an age of ever increasing false fronts and posturing, it's rare to catch a glimpse of a soul bared. But that is exactly what Gomez has done.

It is something so engrained in our history, folklore, tradition, and mythology that it is not as simple as just \"becoming\" Americana, but rather, it is something that you are born into. It's that old cast-iron Coca-Cola sign that's been in your neighbor's shed for 50 years, a banjo and a Fender telecaster playing together, a 1955 Chevy with a modern stereo.\r\n\r\nThere are few artists that can truly encapsulate the essence and true range of Americana like Muscle Shoals artist Hannah Aldridge, whose musical pedigree precedes her and speaks for itself.\r\n\r\nHannah Aldridge is the daughter of Alabama Music Hall of Famer Walt Aldridge, who is one of the most prolific songwriters of the modern musical era. Twice named by Billboard magazine as one of the Top Country Songwriters of the year, ASCAP Songwriter of the Year, and countless Number One and Top Ten hits recorded by the likes of Lou Reed, Reba McEntire, Travis Tritt, Earl Thomas Conley, Ricky Van Shelton, Ronnie Milsap, and Conway Twitty.\r\n\r\nWith sounds ranging from blues in the Mississippi Delta to the dusty, dixieland jazz sounds from New Orleans, the musical stylings of Muscle Shoals on up to the primitive roots of American Country music, Hannah Aldridge leaves no inspiration or influence untapped. \r\n\r\n\"I think people have forgotten what real drums and real voices sound like. We have been so overexposed to these pre-packaged \"#1 hits\" that when there is anything that has any glimpse of truth or rawness to it, it is like a fresh breath of air. Americana music really is lyrically driven and is meant to make people think, which is the total opposite of most of the stuff out there on the radio, so I think that naturally people are being drawn towards it.\" says Aldridge.\r\n\r\nBesides being a seasoned staff songwriter for BAR Music with song placements in television shows like Hart of Dixie(CW) and recognition from American Songwriter as well as Relix Magazine, her vocal talents rarely go unrecognized, something that lends itself to being true to the Americana methodology of not using excessive \"talent-enhancing\" techniques in the studio or live. Both her natural and cultivated talent help her to emote with both listeners and musicians alike on a truly organic level.\r\n\r\nSeasoned by both life events and musical events since the release of her first EP, \"Wanderer\" in 2011, Hannah's upcoming release \"Born to be Broken\" shows a stark difference of growth in musical sensibility, writing, and maturity.\r\n\r\nHannah has toured all across the United States and Europe gaining a grassroots movement of fans that wait in silent adoration of the return of their Americana Heir Apparent Princess of Muscle Shoals.","songs":[{"title":"Lord Only Knows","soundcloud_url":"","soundcloud_furl":"https://soundcloud.com/hannah-aldridge/lord-only-knows","duration":"3:35"},{"title":"Forest Fire Demo","soundcloud_url":"","soundcloud_furl":"https://soundcloud.com/hannah-aldridge/forest-fire-demo","duration":"4:40"}],"videos":[{"youtubeid":"PzbjYNs7AAY","title":"Howlin' Bones"}]},{"name":"Old Capital Square Dance Club","website":"http://www.oldcapitalmusic.com/","facebook":"354674221480","description":"If Hank Williams, The Rolling Stones, Gram Parsons, and a few members of the Traveling Wilburys sat down and got to know each other for a few days, Old Capital Square Dance Club may emerge.

After writing her first song at fifteen she knew right away she wanted to be an artist.  Elliot currently lives in Nashville and continues to write, perform and collaborate with other songwriters, musicians, and artists under the watchful eye of Grammy winning producer Paul Worley (Lady Antebellum, Dixie Chicks, Martina McBride).\r\n\r\nIn 2013, “Ghosts Roam This Town” won an Independent Music Award for best acoustic song.  More recently, “Beating Of My Heart” was featured as a Daily Discovery on AmericanSongwriter.com.\r\n\r\nPhoebe Elliot’s new album “Beating Of My Heart.” (due out October 7th) is the intimate sharing of this songwriter’s heart and soul.  Channeling a stream of sadness, joy and memories, it forms tumultuous rapids at times, serene mirror-like pools at others. Floating above like a subtle descant is an evocation of things to come.\r\n\r\nShe describes her new work as braver, more honest than what came before.  ”Some of the lyrics are especially raw,” she said, “but musically the new work plays by the rules.”  Still, it’s clear she’s not afraid to break the rules.  ”I’ve grown, lived longer.. I’ve had more experiences good and bad. I’ve taken time to reflect on the past.  But I’m still young, too, and hopefully and naive in many ways.”\r\n\r\nIn “Beating Of My Heart,” maturity tangoes with innocence, and we, the listeners are close enough to hear the dancers’ breath and feel their pulse.","songs":[{"title":"Leavin'","soundcloud_url":"","soundcloud_furl":"https://soundcloud.com/phoebe-elliot/leavin","duration":"3:56"},{"title":"Come On In","soundcloud_url":"","soundcloud_furl":"https://soundcloud.com/phoebe-elliot/come-on-in","duration":"3:50"}],"videos":[{"youtubeid":"mf54nGL6EpY","title":"Phoebe Elliot Live"}]}]},{"datetime":"2015-05-02T00:05:00.000Z","link":"http://www.ciceros-stl.com/event/816815-bar-stage-matt-klose-st-louis/","ticketlink":"https://www.ticketfly.com/purchase/event/816815","slug":"2015-05-02-ciceros","created_at":"2015-04-24T00:06:45.504Z","updated_at":"2015-04-27T01:10:57.910Z","venue":{"name":"Ciceros","address":"","coverimg":""},"artists":[{"name":"Matt Klose","website":"","facebook":"MattKloseMusic","description":"I am a musician, a guitarist, a songwriter.

Although different players have come and gone in the band, its musical spirit and intent has remained. It was started as a duo by guitarist and vocalist, Randy Furrer and Tim Fahy in the mid-1970’s. Lead guitarist, Dave Casper, joined soon after. Joe Trunko (bass and vocals) joined in 1990, and Bill Noltkamper (keyboards and vocals) joined in 1991. The newest member of the band is Ryan Wilhite on drums/percussion (joined in 2005). \r\n\r\nOver the years, Jake’s Leg has played to thousands of people, cutting across age and lifestyle demographics. To say they copy the Dead would be a mistake. They tend to interpret the material with their own identity musically and emotionally. For instance, Dave Casper’s lead solos pay homage to Jerry Garcia, but also Pat Metheny, Carlos Santana and Miles Davis. This hybrid of styles ends up working into the music.\r\n\r\nThere is a distinct joy that takes place on any given evening that transcends the typical musical experience.
